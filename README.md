# TongueNet-DGRL 🔬👅

## About 📋

TongueNet-DGRL is an AI-powered framework that revolutionizes Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) tongue diagnosis for liver fibrosis detection 🏥. 

**Note: Code will be made publicly available upon paper acceptance and publication 📚.**

## Overview 🎯

Liver fibrosis affects millions worldwide, making early detection critical for effective treatment 🚨. While TCM tongue diagnosis offers valuable insights, it traditionally relies on practitioner experience and subjective interpretation. Our solution bridges this gap by:

- **🔍 Automating tongue attribute analysis** - Identifying seven critical tongue characteristics through advanced AI
- **🕸️ Modeling complex relationships** - Understanding how different tongue features interact for accurate diagnosis  
- **💡 Providing interpretable results** - Delivering visualizable diagnostic reasoning that mirrors TCM practitioners' thought processes
- **🚀 Achieving superior performance** - Significantly outperforming existing methods in both accuracy and clinical utility

## Key Innovation ⭐

Unlike "black box" AI systems, TongueNet-DGRL provides transparent, explainable diagnostics 🔓. The framework not only predicts liver fibrosis risk but also reveals which tongue attributes contribute to the diagnosis and how they relate to each other - making it a valuable clinical decision support tool 🩺.

## Impact 🌟

This work represents a significant step toward digitizing and standardizing TCM practices while maintaining their interpretability and clinical relevance 📈. It offers healthcare providers an objective, efficient tool for liver fibrosis screening that complements traditional diagnostic methods.
